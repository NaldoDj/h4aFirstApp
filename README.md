# h4aFirstApp
First attempt to create working Harbour application for Android


#### Changelog:

2015-02-18:  New Java source file added - MainApp.java, which subclasses the
   Application class and all Harbour VM initialization code is moved there.
   This allows to solve problem with closing an application after the user
   simply rotate the screen.
